# INST414-final-project-vgsales (Spring 2022)
comparison of algorithms in predicting a video game's genre namely:

* Logistic Regression

* Decision Tree Classification with display of tree with tree.plot_tree or graphviz

* XGBoost with display of feature importance

*  Neural Network (Keras)

* Neural Network (Pytorch)

## Conclusion
Under the vgsales dataset and the variables in consideration (rank, name, platform, release year, publisher, and global sales amount),
logistic regression and XGBoost performed the best with both being able to predict genre at ~35%.
